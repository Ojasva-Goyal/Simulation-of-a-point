# Simulation-of-a-point
# Problem Statement
Generate a simulation of a point that follows the trajectory given below
![trajectory](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97733600/194839374-4debfcdb-74db-444a-8a5a-a171a8a3806d.png)
Such that the swing phase takes 80%, and the supporting phase (stance) takes 20% of the total time T. The suitable values of h, S, base joint height, and T are taken to generate the given trajectory. Also, a smooth change in acceleration at any point of the trajectory is maintained.

Use pyhon to generate the simulation.
